  - "Dear Agung, <br><br>  I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry for everything. It was
    supposed to be just a few weeks, a blink of an eye and then I\u2019d be home,
    picking you up to put on my shoulders. But it's been years since you were small
    enough to ride on shoulders. I've missed your entire childhood. <br><br>  You're
    a man now. What kind of man have you become? There were so many things I was
    going to teach you, so many things we were going to do together. These letters
    are a poor consolation for growing up without a father.  "
  - "You\u2019ll tell me I had no choice. But there's always a choice, isn't there?
    I could have taken you and fled into the jungle. Anything to escape this endless
    war. <br><br>  But it\u2019s too late now. <br><br>  Love, Dad "
