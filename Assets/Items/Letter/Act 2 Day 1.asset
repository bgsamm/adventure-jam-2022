  - "Dear Agung, <br><br>  Happy birthday! I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t be there.
    I know, that\u2019s what I said last year, and the year before. Where has it
    all gone? <br><br>  I\u2019ve sent you a present. It was so heavy the myna could
    barely lift it! It\u2019s a prayer rug I bought from one of the roadside vendors.
    How they keep on throughout it all and still find the strength to make beautiful
    things I can\u2019t imagine. "
  - "Pray for an end to the war, and for us here at the front. There isn\u2019t a
    single day when I don\u2019t pray to see you again. <br><br>  Love, Dad "
