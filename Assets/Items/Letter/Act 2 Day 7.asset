  - "Dear Agung, <br><br>  I spent some time talking with the POWs today. They\u2019re
    just boys, hardly older than you. They weren\u2019t angry with us. Tired, mostly.
    For them, this war has felt like their whole lives. They\u2019d heard that we
    treat our captives fairly, and when we burst into their camp, it just didn\u2019t
    seem worth fighting. "
  - "They showed me photos of their families and their girls back home. I promised
    I\u2019d have the myna deliver a letter for them so their families won\u2019t
    worry about them. I know how you\u2019d worry if it were me. <br><br>  I don\u2019t
    see why rounding them up and pointing a gun at them was worth a medal. Are all
    acts of bravery like that? <br><br>  Love, Dad "
