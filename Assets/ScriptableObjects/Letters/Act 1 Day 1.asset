  - "Dear Agung,<br><br>  Your father in uniform! I bet you never thought you\u2019d
    see that. Truth be told, neither did I, but at moments like this, we all must
    do our part, even those of us who are more fit to hold a spade than a gun.<br><br> 
    Take care of the garden until I come back, won\u2019t you? Here are some sweet
    potato slips to get you started. Growing them is a piece of cake. Just plant
    them in good rich earth and water them every day. I\u2019ve also sent along some
    ripe sweet potatoes to stock the stand with in the meantime. "
  - "Most of all, take care of our tree. When you water it, I hope you\u2019ll remember
    the day we planted it together. This cheeky little myna bird has agreed to carry
    my mail. If you see her perched on the tree in the evening, you\u2019ll know
    there\u2019s a letter from me.<br><br>  I\u2019ll be home soon.<br><br> Love,
    Dad "
