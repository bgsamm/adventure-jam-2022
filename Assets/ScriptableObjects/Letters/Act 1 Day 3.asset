  - "Dear Agung, <br><br>  We\u2019re shipping out. I\u2019d held onto the rather
    selfish hope that I might get an assignment behind the lines, a cook maybe, or
    even a ditch digger. But no, I'm in the infantry. <br><br>  Please try not to
    worry about me. So far your old man hasn\u2019t faced anything worse than mosquitoes
    and monsoon heat. Word among the men is that the war will be over in another
    month. "
  - 'How are things at home? Old Indah from the farm down the road said she''d look
    in on you as often as she could. Don''t be afraid to accept help, son. In war,
    good friends are sometimes the only thing you can rely on.<br><br>  Love, Dad '
