  - "Dear Agung, <br><br>  Advance. Retreat. Advance. Retreat. Are we still winning?
    It\u2019s hard to tell. There\u2019s always another hill to capture, another
    river to cross. The mud, the smoke, and the bombs are always the same.<br><br> 
    The only thing that changes is me. Artillery doesn\u2019t startle me anymore.
    When we eat our tinned rations, I think less and less of the crisp, sweet sugar
    cane that must be ready to harvest right about now. "
  - "I don\u2019t hear anyone saying the war will be over in a month anymore. I\u2019m
    afraid to think what the future might hold if it drags on. What will become of
    us, out here on the front? What will become of the garden? What will become of
    you?<br><br>  Love, Dad "
