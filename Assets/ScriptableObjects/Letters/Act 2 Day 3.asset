  - 'Dear Agung, <br><br>  I was reminiscing today. I know, I sound like an old man.
    But I was watching the farmers out sowing the fields and it brought back the
    days when I was growing up. Planting time was always my favorite season. <br><br> 
    When your aunts and I were little, Indah would pay us in sweets to chase off
    the birds who tried to eat the seeds. Now I suspect she was just keeping us out
    of the way. But we took our job very seriously! '
  - "Indah already seemed older than the hills back then. It\u2019s nice to think
    that some things back home haven\u2019t changed at all. <br><br>  Love, Dad "
