  - "Dear Agung: <br><br>  Do you remember how you used to be fascinated by dreams?
    Nearly every morning you\u2019d tell me yours. I hope they still intrigue you,
    because I had a dream last night, and you were in it. <br><br>  We were in the
    garden, and you were a child again. Our tree had grown so big that it took up
    the entire sky, but instead of leaves, it had pieces of glass in all different
    colors, and the wind made them tinkle against each other and sparkle like stars.
    Thousands of birds of all kinds came and roosted in the branches.  "
  - 'How big our tree must be now, the real one! It must be almost ready to bear
    acorns. Thank you for taking such good care of it. I like to think of how, when
    this war is long over, future generations will still be sitting in its shade.
    <br><br>  Love, Dad '
