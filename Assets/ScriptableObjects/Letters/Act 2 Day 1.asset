  - "Dear Agung, <br><br>  Happy birthday! I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t be there.
    I know, that\u2019s what I said last year, and the year before. Where has it
    all gone? <br><br>  I\u2019ve sent you a present I bought from one of the roadside
    vendors: Moon orchid seeds. Moon orchids are a symbol of peace, you know. How
    she managed to cultivate such a delicate plant amid all the bombings I can\u2019t
    imagine. I know they\u2019ll thrive in our garden. "
  - "Pray for an end to the war, and for us here at the front. There isn\u2019t a
    single day when I don\u2019t pray to see you again. <br><br>  Love, Dad "
