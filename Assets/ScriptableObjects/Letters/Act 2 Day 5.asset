  - "Dear Agung, <br><br>  Your dad is a hero! And no one is more surprised than
    me.  Two of us were scouting ahead through the jungle when we stumbled onto an
    advance enemy squadron. They\u2019d stopped to make camp and weren\u2019t keeping
    watch, and they surrendered to us without firing a shot. "
  - "I earned a medal for courage. I can\u2019t say I felt very courageous--they
    were just lounging around with their tin dishes of stew, and one of them was
    in the middle of shaving. Maybe courage never feels the way it seems like it
    should. <br><br>  I\u2019ve enclosed my medal for you. Its shape makes me think
    of the view of the stars from our garden at night. Maybe it will bring you luck.
    <br><br>  Love, Dad "
